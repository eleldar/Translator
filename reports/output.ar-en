 That case was resolved with the same evidence as at least 10 years ago, and if justice is a form of deterrent to prevent people from committing crimes, impunity in Colombia is an incentive to commit the crime if it is difficult to condemn one of them, even if he is guilty.
 The State must publicly condemn violence against journalists, investigate, prosecute those convicted with credibility, and deter those who ask himself to commit the same offence in the future.
 The [Government] of Colombia has adopted a programme to protect journalists under threat, which is still in place so far, but the programme has a particularly conflicting record after journalists have lost confidence in it after ensuring a complicity between the security forces responsible for the implementation of the programme and the journalists' targets.
 In September, the People's Party submitted to Parliament a draft law that would draft the principle of individual bankruptcy, which would alter the rules of engagement on debt collection
 Although the law is still under review, his proposals claim that, with such protection, individuals will not be deprived of their homes.
 After a deadly shooting in Almaty, the largest cities of the country, officials pointed out that the practice of collecting the "dignity" debt was the main motive of the gunman.
 I also learned a lot of things through the road about the art of art.
 And I believe I still know.
 The commercial side was a very complicated way of obtaining print and publication rights, and so on.
 The draft book began in 2017 and was published last in 2020.
 So, in addition to the artistic and commercial aspects, I learned the art of patience and self-disciplinaryness to continue despite obstacles.
 Finally, I want to be and do what I want to see in the world.
 If I want more diverse books from South Asia to be accepted and read, I have to do my duty of moral citizenship to it.
 I see the positive energy in this work is more productive than the mere complaint than the problems I find through the literary arena.
 Right now, it's an individual risk because I can't pay anyone, but I hope I find some funding options so I can pay some personalities for audits and interviews.
 Let's see.
 The story is not about the health of prisoners, but about the health of the country itself.
 The story of a legacy of a legacy's repressive tools has been in the past generations, and it's been blowing up in the crater for generations to come.
 The complete removal of the voice and body is the heart of the dawn in the closet.
 We guess the word means an explicit decision to persist in hostility and injury.
 But if you see me and you hear me, the chances of falling back and calming down are still open.
 And if we don't take advantage of it, we'll at least continue in a debt situation.
 The top of the wall is not to see me and not to try to understand me; to turn into an article just to remove, kill, block, hide or exclude, to turn into a symbol or conflict without physical existence.
 The dawn in the closet is a legacy that pays for all the bodies and continues to pay for it even after the bond is over.
 How do we protect our children from this prison legacy?
 Although the Russian hydrogen strategy is the most recent public document, and most detailed about the view of carmlin on hydrogen, it is far from changing the rules of the game in the country's energy sector.
 In fact, just like many other similar documents that are supposed to lead the development of the Russian energy industry, it seems to be a reaction, not a proactive one, where it was adopted more than a year after the country's major energy partners formulated their hydrogen strategies.
 Some are called the Swiss fuel knife, which is unique in many ways.
 Given that it's the most abundant element in the universe, there won't be a shortage of supplies.
 It can transform energy from an electrical form to a chemical, and store it for a long time and transfer it where it is needed.
 Yet, it's obvious to see that carbon dioxide doesn't flow from it when it burns.
 Actually, only water is generated as a secondary product.
 Many Syrian youths have started to leave South Syria since the beginning of the current 2021, because of the instability of the region there, and because they fear that they will be taken into compulsory service in the Syrian regime and married in the fronts of the fighting in the north of the country.
 Many of them agreed to sell their valuable things in Syria for money to smugglers in Libya, to transfer them to Italy and Malta by boat across the Mediterranean.
 We almost got close to the Italian coast, and then a boat came close to the boat we were taking, and they started signaling us with their hands, we decided to flee, but the ship landed a small boat with six armed, and they chased us and shot our boat's engine so they could turn it off, and the boat approached and transported us, where there were about 600 other immigrants of different nationalities.
 The European Union is responsible for Libya's migration directly or by disregarding its actions, where armed groups benefiting from migrants are financed and cohesive with such crimes, owing to the inadmissibility of demanding responsibilities and accountability in resettlement dynamics or the use of external sources of immigration control
 In addition to Peru's June elections, misleading information was disseminated on the Internet and, in fact, with regard to the electoral process, many of them - as was seen by other countries - related to the attempt to undermine confidence in the electoral authorities, as well as the failure to hire false and true information for political purposes; such as the circulation of news on voter registration, and the reference that the lists contained the names of the deceased, but ignored information on the timetable and the procedure for amending and ending the lists.
 Misled information was disseminated during those protests and during demonstrations in Colombia, and local sources reported that hundreds of videos, audio recordings, and Internet photos of the national strike had been distributed, ensuring many of the false content, which had a significant impact on actual street events.
 There have also been acts of violence outside the scope of popular demonstrations; there has been increased hearing of verbal and actual attacks against the press by high-level government officials, and at least four journalists have been killed since January 2021 in Latin America.
 Now, after full Taliban control, Afghan citizens are in a state of fear and turmoil as diplomats, and representatives of international organizations are currently fleeing Afghanistan.
 I've seen blind men on their heads, and with guns in their hands, their Honda motorcycles take off in the middle of the night, and they're staring at "The Greater God" and entering the Bodak Spin.
 Then I decided to find a safer place for my family.
 I left for Pakistan, and I entered the Shaman border gate.
 The people of Spain knew they couldn't keep living safely in the area, for fear of the Taliban coming in with the same intentions they had in the past.
 One of the most affected groups from that ongoing war of decades is Afghan women, who are now facing a tough and new reality.
 They fear that the loss of their life patterns and their lack of access to education as well as the total violation of fundamental rights will await them under Taliban rule.
 In recent years, while sexual education curricula have remained remote in most Arab countries, several Arab women have taken on the task of providing alternative and providing sex information through social media for more curious young people.
 In the rest of the Arab world, sexual education remains confined within the established boundaries of religion and biology, limited to carefully selected subjects such as puberty, genital mutilation and sexually transmitted diseases.
 In contrast, talk about sexual activity, fertility, sexual abuse, safe sex, concepts of satisfaction, gender diversity, etc., is limited to sensations shared by students in school curricula, often based on unscientific content or pornography via the Internet, if not completely closed.
 If we keep avoiding these things and treat sex education as forbidden, we're actually hurting the people we're trying to protect.
 We're having a huge abuse of girls when they've been hiding the truth for a long time, leaving them unprepared for their relationships and perhaps even more vulnerable to abuse and abuse.
 They're asking for contributions after an earthquake, a flood, a fire, and a pandemic.
 Of course we'll do what we can to help those in need, but will those who lead us do the same?
 The people of multi-ethnic Uzbekistan, including a large group of Arab Iranians, have complained repeatedly and repeatedly about the lack of clean water, but they have been accepted as State repression policies.
 The march has spread in many other provinces since the beginning of the protests, where citizens have made their solidarity with the inhabitants of Kuzstan.
 New protests belong to the middle class and to the poor and mainly to the neighbourhoods and parts of the country, while the green movement, for example, was the norm between the upper middle class in the major cities.
 While the demonstrators in the past two decades have been somewhat sympathetic to the so-called reformal section, the new wave of protests does not distinguish between the different factions of the regime and against the entire State of the Islamic Republic, which is not only brutal and cruel, but also extremely corrupt and inefficient.
